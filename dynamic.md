# Dynamic Game Components Planning

## Features:
The main feature of the game is time, which is intricately composed. While players can earn time through tasks, the total time they have is affected by other factors. For instance, a player who gets injured may die because their health index reaches zero. Similarly, hunger can lead to death, or a player who plays for extended periods might "age," affecting the total time available to them. The general calculation is as follows: Time = Hunger * Age * Health * Total time accrued through tasks...

## Locations:
Players begin the game in a safe village where, during initial tasks, they learn how to play. The overall map design includes marking and designing necessary objects for task completion. This intuitive design leads players to desired locations. For example, at the beginning of the game, the player is placed next to an apple triggering an initial dialogue about hunger. A quick exploration of the map then leads them to a forest above the village where they'll need to solve puzzles while avoiding wolves.

## Behaviors:
Time is a crucial element in our game. We aim to incorporate dilemmas throughout the game influenced by time. For instance, choosing between two different paths to the same destination based on speed versus danger. Players can indirectly steal items to save time but will face conflicts.

## Economic System:
The game is not multiplayer, so there's no external economic system to adapt. However, we aim to integrate an internal trading system based on time. For example, a player who spends all their time buying items will jeopardize their gameplay continuity and will need to avoid injury, aging, or hunger.

## Information:
Apart from initial guidance, players have no additional information. They explore the world, perform tasks, and discover. The goal is for players to replay the game multiple times, learning more about gameplay and how to survive longer each time.

## Control:
Players have real-time control, free movement via the keyboard, and deal with conflicts and tasks in real-time.

## Choices and Strategy:
The game will feature constant dilemmas. For instance, between the first and second cities, players can choose from several routes: a long path forcing an almost immediate departure, a winding path forcing players to remember the correct route by heart, or a shorter but more dangerous path where players need to solve specific puzzles to arrive on time and unscathed.
