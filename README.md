# TimeLessWorld

Welcome to TimeLessWorld, an indie top-down RPG pixel art game created by Sagi Yosef Azulay, Ohad Taizi, and Noya Gendelman. 

## Overview

TimeLessWorld introduces a unique timer mechanic where time is the currency of the game. Players must manage their time, health points (HP), and hunger (starve) to progress through the game. The timer serves as a crucial element, as when it runs out, the player starts the game from the beginning.

## Gameplay

As players navigate the pixelated world, they encounter various monsters that cannot be defeated. Instead, players must skillfully avoid these creatures to reach their objective. Along the way, they must also attend to their character's needs by eating to stave off hunger and healing to maintain their health points and time.

## Development

TimeLessWorld originated as the final project of a game development course at Ariel University. The development team crafted this game with passion and dedication, aiming to offer players a unique and engaging experience.
